To set up your project for automation practice and push it to a GitHub repository, follow these steps. I'll guide you through creating a new GitHub repository, adding your files, and pushing them to the repository. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. **Log in to GitHub**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in with your account.
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on the "+" icon at the top right corner and select "New repository".
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., `automation-practice`).
   - Optionally, add a description.
   - Choose to make the repository public or private.
   - Do not initialize the repository with a README file.
   - Click the "Create repository" button.

### Step 2: Set Up Git on Your Local Machine

1. **Open Command Prompt**: Open Command Prompt (cmd) on your local machine.
2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Change the directory to where your HTML files are located. For example:
   ```sh
   cd "C:\Users\mahesh shelke\Desktop\admissionForm"
   ```

3. **Initialize Git**: Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

### Step 3: Add Files to the Repository

1. **Add Your Files**: Add your HTML files to the staging area:
   ```sh
   git add admission.html confirmation.html login.html
   ```

2. **Commit the Files**: Commit your files with a descriptive commit message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Initial commit with admission, confirmation, and login HTML files"
   ```

### Step 4: Connect to GitHub Repository and Push

1. **Add Remote Repository**: Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository you created. Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with the name of your repository:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/automation-practice.git
   ```

2. **Push Files to GitHub**: Push your committed files to the remote repository:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### Step 5: Verify the Repository

1. **Check GitHub**: Go to your GitHub repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/automation-practice`) and verify that your files have been uploaded.

### Example Commands

Here are the complete commands you will run in Command Prompt:

```sh
cd "C:\Users\mahesh shelke\Desktop\admissionForm"
git init
git add admission.html confirmation.html login.html
git commit -m "Initial commit with admission, confirmation, and login HTML files"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/automation-practice.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Final Notes

- Ensure you have Git installed on your local machine. You can download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- If you face any authentication issues, ensure you have configured your GitHub credentials correctly. You can use personal access tokens for authentication if you're using GitHub's two-factor authentication.

Now you can test your automation scripts locally with the files in your GitHub repository. You can clone the repository to other machines or share it with collaborators if needed.
